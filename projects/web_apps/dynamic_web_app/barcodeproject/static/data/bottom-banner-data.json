Sunflowers showed a robust growth rate of 20%, likely benefiting from optimal environmental conditions. Conversely, Roma Tomatoes experienced a slight decrease in growth rate by approximately -5.00%, which could indicate stress factors or natural growth cycles affecting their development. Pumpkins, Carrots, and Garlic exhibited impressive growth rates, each surging by approximately 47.78%, suggesting highly favorable growing conditions or successful cultivation practices. Less pronounced but significant growth was observed in Cucumbers and Red Bell Peppers, each with growth rates of about 23.08% and 45.45%, respectively. Herbs like Oregano and Dill also showed remarkable growth rates of 51.11% and 50.00%, underlining their adaptability to current growing conditions. This spectrum of growth rates provides crucial insights into the responsiveness of different crops to their cultivation environments and will guide future agricultural decisions."
